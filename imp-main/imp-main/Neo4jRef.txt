Neo4j crud queries
ChatGPT
Neo4j is a graph database management system that uses a query language called Cypher to interact with the data. Cypher provides a set of commands for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data. Here are some examples of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) queries in Neo4j using Cypher:

Create a node:
css
Copy code
CREATE (n:Label {property: value})
This query creates a node with a specific label and properties.

Read a node:
css
Copy code
MATCH (n:Label {property: value})
RETURN n
This query finds a node with a specific label and property value and returns it.

Update a node:
vbnet
Copy code
MATCH (n:Label {property: value})
SET n.property = new_value
This query finds a node with a specific label and property value and updates its property to a new value.

Delete a node:
css
Copy code
MATCH (n:Label {property: value})
DELETE n
This query finds a node with a specific label and property value and deletes it.

Create a relationship between nodes:
css
Copy code
MATCH (n1:Label1 {property1: value1}), (n2:Label2 {property2: value2})
CREATE (n1)-[r:REL_TYPE]->(n2)
This query creates a relationship of a specific type between two nodes with their respective labels and property values.

Read a relationship:
css
Copy code
MATCH (n1:Label1 {property1: value1})-[r:REL_TYPE]->(n2:Label2 {property2: value2})
RETURN r
This query finds a relationship of a specific type between two nodes with their respective labels and property values and returns it.

Update a relationship:
css
Copy code
MATCH (n1:Label1 {property1: value1})-[r:REL_TYPE]->(n2:Label2 {property2: value2})
SET r.property = new_value
This query finds a relationship of a specific type between two nodes with their respective labels and property values and updates its property to a new value.

Delete a relationship:
css
Copy code
MATCH (n1:Label1 {property1: value1})-[r:REL_TYPE]->(n2:Label2 {property2: value2})
DELETE r
This query finds a relationship of a specific type between two nodes with their respective labels and property values and deletes it.

These are basic examples of CRUD queries in Neo4j using Cypher. Depending on your specific data model and requirements, you may need to modify these queries accordingly.
